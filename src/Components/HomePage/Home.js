              ? Don‚Äôt worry! I got it for you! Keeping one‚Äôs self going is a
              difficult thing to do. There are a million distractions that occur
              every day and that can mean that we do not stay on track with what
              we should be doing. Self-motivation is something that does not
              come easy to a lot of people and that means that there are some
              steps that need to be taken before you can become motivated to the
              fullest extent.

        Currently,I am Student of Premier University,Chittagong.I am Completing
        my BSC Degree in Computer Science Here.As an Student I have pressures of
        joining my Classes regularly and take part of Class Test,Quizes and
        exams.That's why it's tough for me to Join anywhere as an Junior Web
        Developer.Because If I Join Any Company I have to Spend Minimum 6-8
        Hours there which is currently very tough for me!So,I have decided to
        before I complete my undergraduation I must practise Javacript,React
        JS,Node JS,MongoDB Regularly and Join Online Based Freelancing
        marketplaces like - "Fiverr","UpWork" etc. to Become a Freelancer.I am
        very Hopeful to Complete my Goals in next 4 months!!'
